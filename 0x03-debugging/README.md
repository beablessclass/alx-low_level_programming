Duplicate this primary file. Add comments to deactivate (without removal!) the segment of code responsible for the perpetual loop in the output.

Please abstain from inserting or deleting any lines of code, as our line tally will be used for evaluation. Solely existing code is to be commented out.
Compiling with -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic is unnecessary for this assignment.
